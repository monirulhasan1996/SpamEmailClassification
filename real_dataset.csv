0,california executive summary bottom line qfs better off today utilities worse shapeafter passing senate the bill fails technical grounds assemblycal energy ruling provides possible escape for qfs from utility commitmentscalifornia net short gas supply for the summer worsens qfs break contractshedge funds acquiring utility commercial paper further litigation expected bill fails surprise twistab the bill failed the assembly the republicans were opposed because three measures the sdg fix the fix and the fix were all rolled into one bill the senate they want the three measures split concern was raised san diego members regarding those provisions and they wanted see separately the bill form that currently noted yesterday the qfs will now await cpuc ruling tuesday cal energy ruling sets stage for dozens similar suitsthe cpuc ruling now less important because the cal energy ruling yesterday which gave the qfs another tactic escape their commitments the near bankrupt utilities cal energy reportedly would have filed involuntary bankruptcy tomorrow friday had they not won their law suit dozens not hundreds suits identical that filed calenergy can now expected from the other qfs the qfs reportedly see themselves free from the utilities now and want sell direct into the merchant market possibly out state they also want avoid any deal whereby the state would force them supply power stage stage alert and will contest any such measure with the ferc summer outlook worsensthe outlook for the summer now appears much grimmer for the state the gas fired qfs alone manage extricate themselves from their contracts with the utilities the state will net short for the summer rather than this much larger net short position fill and will much harder for state treasurer angelides sell wall street all the qfs break their contracts the state will short essentially the qfs are successful court appears they would they are longer part the pool low fixed rate power that the state can count the onus now appears treasurer angelides come with rate schedule the qfs may him and ask for the state act forward cover for their gas contracts the state would course charge for this privilege and negotiate more flexible rate structure pressure mounts utilitiesnone this helps the utilities situation fact now that the qfs have way out their contracts through the courts appears that the business base the utilities reduced they are actually worse situation reportedly some the utilities commercial paper now has been sold hedge funds one source put the vultures have moved these are the types people who litigate

0, out interestthis more than you ever wanted know about catalytica there any point regurgitating that point would that this deal didn make dime for enron got gift would see million from enron and catalytica got off scot free the december dash summarized the eight agreements associated with the transactions permit the following sale and repurchase the spark spread option funding xonon development amount equal the proceeds the option sale funding the turbine prepayment the pastoria project with the same option sale proceeds obtaining the right first refusal the first five commercial fas equipped with xonon and purchase the turbines off balance sheet basis enhancing the value the equity investment catalytica was mentioned strategic benefit and potential upside turbine overpricing was not mentioned the dash the risk matrix when dave added his comments the may dash understood that the million cost was intended offset million turbine credits doing allocation the cost seemed logically mean allocation the credits once they were recognised outside the slim chance that something blew the allocated cost would offset with subsequently allocated credit wash from ena perspective the issue moot the decision allocate portion the turbine overpricing the merchant portfolio but none the credits that clearly was not accounted for and certainly was not provided for the merchant asset management plan forwarded richard lydecker corp enron richard lydecker amto christopher calger pdx ect ectcc subject out interestchris thanks for the clarification pat did confirm with sheila that the turbines were overpriced which seems mean that enron ended giving gift million that seems strange also still seems that the december dash did not accurately reflect the deal unless missed did not find any reference turbine overpricing understanding dave comment the may dash was account for the acceleration period between may and september and the risk that the pastoria project would cancelled and the technology development fail that period may ena gave the opportunity stick catalytica with credits payment for the repurchase the sso rather than cash either these events occured before september and thereby lost the optionality the four months the may transaction did not change the economics the deal any other way than this acceleration the comment was intended allocate the turbine overpricing which was part the original transaction agree with you that this should have been handled that time concern has been that enron retain the benefit the credits referenced the xtia which apparently has occurred however the fact apparently that the credits had been rendered valueless from the start the turbine overpricing framework had been that long enron received the credits some form the may transaction was wash far was concerned dick christopher calger ect pmto richard lydecker corp enron enroncc subject out interestdick sounds though this caught you surprise sorry for that your chronology seems correct this thing makes head hurt every time brought believe the obligation was incurred dec but not properly recognized accounted for until the may dash delainey hand written note was the end result people dissecting the deals with the realization that the west power turbines were overpriced the and the catalytica equity account did not properly account for that dec the turbine contract refers credit but the gross turbine price was increased twice that amount that the net increase was ena agreed because piper wanted help catalytica despite much protest from dave parquet agreed with delainey and ray bowen that west power would the hook for the because the project got some benefit from catalytica delainey wanted the payment triggered sale pastoria because did not want group recognize any income until the project closed this was communicated and acknowledged accounting and reminded them every month two since mid year understand pat called sheila tweed dont think she anyone remembers the details but she should able validate the point about turbine overpricing and the delainey fix may regards chrisrichard lydecker enron pmto christopher calger pdx ect ectcc subject out interestchris couldn agree more about the confusing history the catalytica xtia and spark spread derivative transactions understanding slightly different from what you outline but you may have better sources neither were present the creation familiar with dave delainey hand written note the may dash that dash authorised accelerating repurchase the sso three months view that dave could allocate within ena his discretion did not understand the rationale however since was the december dash which established the obligation for enron fund the million all the may dash did was unwind financing arrangement three months early did not have anything with the incurrence the obligation itself the objective the complex series agreements was for enron finance development the xonon technology and return receive credits turbine purchases either pastoria for other xonon equiped turbines pastoria were cancelled original deal catalytica agreed purchase spark spread option sso from enron for million payable four instalments these instalments exactly matched the funding obligation under the xtia catalytica actually paid enron million which represented the first two instalments west made million milestone payments the enron west arrangement was off balance sheet financing deal the end the day enron was paying september enron was obligated repurchase the sso from catalytica for the amount catalytica had paid enron for turbine credits pastoria were cancelled may sso repurchase enron bought back the sso from catalytica for million the three month acceleration repurchase was supposed facilitate ipo did not impact all enron ultimate obligation which had always been for the full million catalytica was now out the chain and had further payment obligations credit entitlements december final milestone payment enron has paid million through the west financing arrangement now turbo park uncertain whether increased the price the pastoria turbines million part these transactions understanding was that there was concern about this when the turbine contract was negotiated but had thought this concern was guarded against contract negotiation with fact did increase the cost the pastoria turbines million the entire purpose and benefit enron from these incredibly complex and non intuitive documents was totally obviated net net enron would have paid develop technology application with compensatory value why enron would have done this kind deal don know not sure what internal income transfer would apply understand that has applied the million credit against progress payment billing late last year wouldn this mean that the full credit was taken pastoria unclear why the sale pastoria should trigger anything the end the day ena did the deal and how account for the consequences now irrelevant the turbines were overpriced the december dash seems misleading not disclosing that fact when approval was requested the dash actually states that the million would serve down payment for the pastoria turbine package summary may not correct but this the best have been able piece together what happened dick forwarded richard lydecker corp enron louise kitchen ect pmto richard lydecker corp enron enroncc subject out interest forwarded louise kitchen hou ect christopher calger pmto louise kitchen hou ect ectcc subject out interestcalpine reduced their purchase price because the turbine contract for pastoria was overpriced the amount the catalytica credit brief confusing history understand ena east and west jointly owned the catalytica equity account was written based expectations ipo value transferred west power because catalytica entered into agreement with pastoria provide the project with its zonon technology this agreement included commitment from research work order use the catalytica technology turbines the cost this was added the pastoria turbine contract feb when arrived portland had the catalytica account transferred the portfolio because thought was overvalued with little synergies with ena west power mid the agreement was restructured order clean catalytica could ipo that time enron was credited back the from catalytica and was decided delainey that that amount should split pastoria and catalytica equity with the going ena west power upon the sale pastoria pastoria did not get the full back because benefited somewhat from favourable publicity and some interest savings this time since there funds transfer believe simply becomes internal income transfer from the merchant portfolio ena west power louise kitchen amto christopher calger pdx ect ectcc subject out interestwhat happens under the pastoria deal the catalytica credit did calpine are you using the other turbine purchases

0,article about enron wsj april economy electricity facilities sprout near tiny tennessee town john fialka staff reporter the wall street journal nutbush tenn this town about people hasn seen anything quite this electrifying since the when local teenager annie mae bullock left town and became tina turner the queen rock roll power plants are sprouting the flat rich cotton fields nearby one under construction another about start bulldozers are grooming site for third think great says alvin williams owner the nutbush grocery and deli prepares for the surge construction workers who come for lunch while this may seem promising time growing energy shortages the new plants are part power clash that presents the bush administration and federal and state regulators with one their knottiest problems who controls the nation power grid one side new breed freewheeling energy dealers called merchant traders spurred deregulation generate and trade electricity led here enron corp they build small gas fired generating plants but most don construct their own power lines instead they hook the plants existing lines and sell electricity wholesale over long distances when prices peak during the summer thus many their plants are called peakers the other side are old line utilities represented here the federally owned tennessee valley authority they operate the power lines and warn that the system could become overloaded leading blackouts from the imbalance near nutbush here tennessee southwest corner natural gas pipelines run from the gulf coast and intersect with some the tva miles transmission lines which are spread over seven southern states that what making nutbush boom attractive place connect the grid least new merchant plants altogether will hooked across the tva system there will dozens more neighboring systems that will also use tva lines says terry boston tva executive vice president this year tva expects requests for wholesale power deals its system from last year and just boston foresees congestion problem that will make more difficult for the utility maintain its record reliability this summer going interesting says combat started here the spring when enron plant nearby brownsville began bombarding tva with about requests for summer transmission service from the tva had received from merchant plants the year before some were huge elaborate trades involving brokered electricity from other sources that enron wanted ship across the tva system kevin presto enron vice president recalled the tva pretty much fought the whole way even though they needed the megawatts that june tva pulled the plug telling enron that from then its wheeling and dealing would confined the amount electricity produced enron plants enron claimed foul and appealed the north american electric reliability council nerc voluntary organization utilities and electricity consumers along with the federal energy regulatory commission and state regulators nerc functions the traffic cop for north america power grid enron also sued the tva and the dispute raised number issues that are trying put our fingers says don benjamin nerc director operations one upshot that busy rewriting the rules for how the national grid controlled the bush administration energy task force and congress are also looking the control issue and ways expand the grid capacity far they have found easy inexpensive answers the grid with its dense webs surrounding major cities and few links between resembles highway map from the before the interstate system was built and governed rules that were negotiated utilities about that time they began interconnect their systems with their neighbors big utilities became control areas that perform the moment moment adjustments that keep lines from overloading and equipment from melting down with electricity supply must always match demand but lately operators merchant plants such enron have also qualified become control areas regulators have ordered utilities give merchant power plants open access the grid though the utilities sometimes curtail access for reliability reasons this was very good system sighs thomas overbye engineering professor the university illinois but while merchant plants have more access the grid notes they have little incentive build more power lines when you restructure that way asserts overbye you going overload the system and that exactly what happening nerc benjamin worries that control will get harder this summer got able look this and see what effects these deals are having the whole system says some hoc curtailment wholesale deals and service customers may necessary protect the grid but the result will expensive notes means that merchants won make money that deal and that the customer they sold power will have buy from somebody else the summer there were such curtailments last summer there were lynn church president the electric power supply association which represents merchant power companies and electricity traders suspects that decisions taken big utilities for reliability reasons are sometimes used block legitimate competition from her members prevent this her group wants more federal control over the grid seeing lots discrimination the tva boston counters that his system can take more surprises such the one aug when series wholesale trades brought the tva part the grid the brink collapse from the overload this year enron settled its fight with the tva with secret out court settlement enron says also the process selling the plant near here and two others had hooked the tva system other merchant power producers but still waging war over who controls the grid separate case now before the supreme court enron argues that ferc has the power open more the grid capacity merchant power plants utility commissioners from several states argue doesn while this going ferc pondering how cut back the grid proliferating number control areas right now there are about according one ferc expert who asked not identified avoid complications there should around meanwhile officials tina turner home turf still want the power plant construction keep rocking there going others
